To allow access to Gmail, the user has to approve the Demisto app using an oauth2 authorization flow, by clicking on the following [link](https://oproxy.demisto.ninja/gmail). **Note:** The Demisto app is going through the Google verification process. During this time period, while the app is not fully verified, you will recieve from Google an "unverified app" warning in the authorization flow.
After authorizing the Demisto app, you will get an ID, Token, and Key, which should be inserted in the integration instance configuration's corresponding fields. 
 Note: This is a beta Integration, which lets you implement and test pre-release software. Since the integration is beta, it might contain bugs. Updates to the integration during the beta phase might include non-backward compatible features. We appreciate your feedback on the quality and usability of the integration to help us identify issues, fix them, and continually improve.
