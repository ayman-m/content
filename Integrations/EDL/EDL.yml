description: Provides External Dynamic List as a service. An EDL is a text file that
  is hosted on an external web server so that the firewall can import objects—IP addresses,
  URLs, domains—included in the list and enforce policy. The integration allows users
  to add values to the list, remove values from the list, and to consume it as an
  EDL service.
